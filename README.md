# Freddie Mac Mortgage Project
The complete report can be found at my personal website: [https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/mengzhehuang/data-science-projects/freddie-mac-mortgage-default-prediction-using-monthly-performance-data](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/mengzhehuang/data-science-projects/freddie-mac-mortgage-default-prediction-using-monthly-performance-data) 
1) filter mortgages and only terminated (paid-off or charge-off) loans remain; preprocess data, e.g., handle missing values
2) create windowed (time series) dataset for monthly-update performance data and economic factors
3) build, train and evaluate a neural network model
